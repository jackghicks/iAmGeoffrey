IAmGeoffrey
===========

An endless, 'massively multiplayer' struggle to decide, who really is Geoffrey?

The Game
--------

In IAmGeoffrey, you patrol a maze attempting to rack up kills and collect diamonds.  In the maze, you'll find everybody else currently playing, trying to do the same thing.
Your character always faces to the right, and to score a kill you must approach your enemy from the left, stabbing them in the back.

------------

1. Clone the repository
2. Run npm install inside the repository.
3. Run the grunt task.
4. ...
